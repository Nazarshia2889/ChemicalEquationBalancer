    <ol>
      <li>Enter each compound of your unbalanced chemical equation in the corresponding box.</li>
      <li>Write subscripts immediately after each element in the compound <em>(ex. sodium sulfide is Na2S).</em></li>
      <li>Make sure elements are properly capitalized in each compound.</li>
      <li>For polyatomic ions, make sure the "subscript" is written after the ion in parentheses <em>(ex. iron (III) sulfate is Fe2(SO4)3).</em></li>
      <li>Submit and balance!</li>

    <h3 class="center">How it works: </h3>
    <div class="paddingExtra">
      <p>The goal is to balance a chemical equation given the reactants and products and their corresponding subscripts by finding the coefficients to each compound. The equation's coefficients can be viewed as the variables a, b, c, d as follows: </p>
      <p class="center">aA + bB -> cC + dD</p>
      <p>For this example, we will balance the combustion of Benzene (C6H6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O).</p>
      <p>Each string in the input boxes was split into 
two separate dictionaries (reactants and products) with each key representing an elements and the value representing the subscript. Two dictionaries were also made to keep track of each element's index (first, second, third, or fourth box).</p>
      <p>The subscripts were put into a matrix in which the number of rows equals the number of elements and the number of columns equals the number of coefficients (variables a, b, c, and d). The first two columns would correspond to the reactants and the last two columsn would correspond to the products. 
      <br>
      <p>In the combustion of Benzene, the following matrix would represent the coefficients (first row is carbon, second row is hydrogen, third row is oxygen):</p>
      <div class="center">
        <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
              <td> 6,</td>
              <td> 0,</td>
              <td> 0,</td>
              <td>-1 </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td> 6,</td>
              <td> 0,</td>
              <td>-2,</td>
              <td> 0 </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td> 0,</td>
              <td> 2,</td>
              <td>-1,</td>
              <td>-2 </td>
          </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>Next, the matrix is put through a function to be put in reduced row echelon form. For Benzene, the matrix is represented as follows: </p>
      <div class = "center">
        <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
              <td>1,</td>
              <td>0,</td>
              <td>0,</td>
              <td>-0.33</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>0,</td>
              <td>1,</td>
              <td>0,</td>
              <td>-2.5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>0,</td>
              <td>0,</td>
              <td>1,</td>
              <td>-2</td>
          </tr>
        </table> 
      </div>
      <p>Each value in the last column of the matrix, as well as an addition of 1 for the variable d, is multiplied by -1 * the lowest common denominator. For Benzene every value is multiplied by 6 to gain the solutions [2, 15, 12, 6].</p>
